# Description
This folder contains our full PowerPoint presentation for the project. We have an initial analysis slide, slides for each of the tests we performed including descriptions and charts, a slide describing our questions and challenges, a slide with our final conclusions, and lastly, a slide that has our final data dictionary.

### Data Wrangling Project PowerPoint
- We horizontally integrated our files, 'IMDB_Top_250.xlsx' and 'the_oscar_award'
- We performed a variety of tests:
  - Univariate: We looked at one column, 'Nominations', to calculate how many movies were above average or at/below average for the number of nominations they have received
  - Bivariate: We looked at two columns, 'Score' and 'Run_Time_Minutes', to create a scatterplot to see if longer runtimes seem to be more highly rated than shorter runtimes and vice versa
  - Hypothesis Test (T-Test): We figured out that there is no significant difference between award winning movies and non-award winning movies in terms of rating. Since most of the movies were rated above 8, on a 10 point scale, this seems to be accurate
  - Machine Learning: We created a visualization for logistic regression and found that more recent movies are a little bit more popular than older movies
