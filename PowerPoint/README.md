### Data Wrangling Project PowerPoint
- We horizontally integrated our files, 'IMDB_Top_250.xlsx' and 'the_oscar_award'
- We performed a variety of tests:
  - Univariate: We looked at one column, 'Nominations', to calculate how many movies were above average or at/below average for the number of nominations they have received
  - Bivariate: We looked at two columns, 'Score' and 'Run_Time_Minutes', to create a scatterplot
  - Hypothesis Test (T-Test)
  - Visualizations
  - Machine Learning
