This folder cotains our project report.

# Report Layout
  # Introduction
  Our project begins with our introduction. We briefly explain the two data sources we worked with, why we chose the sources, and   why we are performing this analysis.

  # Data
  Our next section is our data section and this portion gives more in depth detail about our data sources. We explain where we got each data source as well as some key information that is important to know about the data within each source. Additionally, we include links to our data sources.

  # Data Dictionary
  The third section of our project is very brief and contains our data dictionary for our final integrated DataFrame. The data dictionary describes the field, type, and description of each column in our final DataFrame.

  # Research Questions
  After the data dictionary section, we included a section about our research questions. We have five research questions in total that analyze different aspects of our two data sources. We list each individual question as well as a description of what the question is analyzing and our goal behind why we asked this specific question.

  # Horizontal Integration/Data Scraping
  The fifth section of our report is our horizontal integration and data scraping portion. Here, we detail how we scraped data from one of our data sources, how we downloaded the data from our other data source, and how we horizontally integrated these two datasets together. We also included a screenshot of our final DataFrame after these two datasets were horizontally integrated.

  # Analysis - Building On Our 'Research Questions'
  Our sixth section contains our in depth analysis for each of our five research questions. We discuss our process for answering each question as well as the results and conclusions we came to. We included screenshots of the charts we built for each research question and have a mix of bar charts, scatter plots, line graphs, and boxplots.

  # Conclusion
  Finally, the last section of the report is our conclusion. We wrap up our report and discuss some of the limitations and challenges we faced when working with the data.
