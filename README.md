# BAIS3250Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze data from two different sources and explore the relationships between the two. Our data is as follows:
- IMDb Top 250 Movies is located under the Movies tab on the IMDb webiste and is a list of the top 250 according to IMDb ratings. The website includes information about the name of the movie, the year it was released, the run time in hours and minutes, and the score the movie received.
- "The Oscar Award, 1927-2025" is a Kaggle data set and contains columns for the year the film was made, the year the ceremony took place, what the number the ceremony was, the category name, the name of the nominee, the title of the film, and finally, a column indicating if the nominee won or lost. This final column had the word "True" if the nominee won and the word "False" if the nominee lost.

## Research Questions
We asked the following research questions to perform analysis on these two data sets and evaluate the relationships that may or may not be present.

### 1.	How many Oscars has each movie won and how many nominations has each movie received â€“ and are movies with Oscars wins more popular than movies without wins?

## Folder Structure
Our repository will have several different folders each with their own set of files. Our folders are as follows:
- Data: This folder contains the links to the platforms we gathered our data from.
- Notebook: This folder contains our Jupyter notebook with our code.
- CSV/Excel: This folder contains the csv and excel files we used throughout the Jupyter notebook to either upload data into the notebook or save data as a DataFrame.
