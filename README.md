# BAIS3250Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze data from two different sources and explore the relationships between the two. Our data is as follows:
- IMDb Top 250 Movies is located under the Movies tab on the IMDb webiste and is a list of the top 250 according to IMDb ratings. The website includes information about the name of the movie, the year it was released, the run time in hours and minutes, and the score the movie received.
- "The Oscar Award, 1927-2025" is a Kaggle data set and contains columns for the year the film was made, the year the ceremony took place, what the number the ceremony was, the category name, the name of the nominee, the title of the film, and finally, a column indicating if the nominee won or lost. This final column had the word "True" if the nominee won and the word "False" if the nominee lost.

## Research Questions
We asked the following research questions to perform analysis on these two data sets and evaluate the relationships that may or may not be present.

#### 1.	How many Oscars has each movie won and how many nominations has each movie received – and are movies with Oscars wins more popular than movies without wins?
- This question helps analyze the relationship between public acclaim and institutional recognition. Year after year, many films beloved by audiences get passed over for awards like the Oscars and vice versa. Our research aims to unpack this problem and see if there is a disconnect between what audiences prefer and what the Academy rewards.

#### 2.	Are movies with longer run times more popular than movies with shorter run times or vice versa?
- This research question explores evolving viewer preferences and storytelling criteria. If shorter movies appear to be more popular, it could be a testament to how viewer’s attention spans have shifted over time, and they want to-the-point storytelling. However, if longer movies appear to be more popular, this could suggest that viewers appreciate a complex and meaningful plotline. We hope that with this analysis, we could help current and future filmmakers cater to the audience’s needs and provide them with insight on how they should structure their storytelling.

#### 3.	Are older movies (before the year 2000) more popular than newer movies (after the year 2000)?
- Finally, our last research question explores the cultural impact and legacy that movies leave on their audiences. This analysis could significantly help filmmakers and production companies create successful movies. If older movies are preferred, this suggests that the audience appreciates nostalgia, and certain themes will always find appeal amongst audiences for years and years to come. Whereas if newer movies are more popular, this could suggest that audience’s preferences shift as the culture and world around them shifts.

#### 4.	What is the average number of Nominations across all movies? Do more movies fall above or below the average?
- Finally, our last research question aims to analyze the average number of nominations across the top 250 movies. We want to see if more movies in the top 250 fall above the average or if more movies fall at/below the average. This can give great insight into if movies with more nominations are more popular than movies that have less nominations and looks at the relationship between audience approval and critical acclaim.

## Folder Structure
Our repository will have several different folders each with their own set of files. Our folders are as follows:
- Data: This folder contains the links to the platforms we gathered our data from.
- Jupyter Notebook: This folder contains our Jupyter notebook with our code.
- CSV/Excel: This folder contains the csv and excel files we used throughout the Jupyter notebook to either upload data into the notebook or save data as a DataFrame.
- PowerPoint: This folder contains our PowerPoint presentation of our data analysis and research findings.
