# BAIS3250Project

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze data from two different sources and explore the relationships between the two. Our data is as follows:
- IMDb Top 250 Movies is located under the Movies tab on the IMDb webiste and is a list of the top 250 according to IMDb ratings. The website includes information about the name of the movie, the year it was released, the run time in hours and minutes, and the score the movie received.
