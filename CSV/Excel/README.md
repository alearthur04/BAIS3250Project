## Table of Contents
| File Name | File Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| IMDb_Top_250.xlsx | Excel file | This Excel file was used to save our movies_df DataFrame. We scraped data about the Top 250 Movies from the IMDb website, edited the run time to minutes, saved the data into a DataFrame, and then saved the DataFrame into the Excel file. |
| the_oscar_award.csv | CSV file | This CSV file contains data about the Oscar ceremonies spanning the years 1927 to 2025. The file was downloaded from Kaggle and read into our Jupyter Notebook for analysis. |
| the_oscar_award.xlsx | Excel file | We converted the_oscar_award.csv file into an Excel file to make horizontal integration with the IMDb_Top_250.xlsx file easier. We uploaded the_oscar_award.xlsx file into a DataFrame called oscars_data_excel. |
